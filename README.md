Creates a New Azure Affinity Group
==================================

            

    This runbook creates a new Affinity Group representing a location.


    This runbook needs a valid Azure Location name to create the Affinity group. There are few valid locations like East US, East Asia and others and any one from them must be used as parameter.



    It checks if the Azure Affinity group alreasy exists within a azure subscription. If it already  exists, then an error message is shown back otherwise a new Affinity group is created.


 


 

 

 


        
    
TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
